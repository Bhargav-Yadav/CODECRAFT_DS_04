Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
This notebook performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets related to various entities. The process involves:

- Data Loading and Inspection: Loading the dataset and examining its structure, including column names, data types, and initial rows.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values by dropping rows with missing content and removing duplicate entries.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of sentiments across the entire dataset and for a specific brand (Microsoft) using        visualizations like bar plots and pie charts.
- Sentiment Analysis (Planned): (This section can be updated after performing sentiment analysis on the text data, e.g., using TextBlob to       calculate polarity and subjectivity scores).

This analysis provides insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the tweets and the sentiment specifically directed towards Microsoft.
